# StockPriceMonteCarlo
This code creates a monte carlo simulation for the stock price of Banner Bank. It was created for the 2020 Spokane CFA Challenge.
It uses the historical mean and standard deviation of Banner's stock price to simulate future stock price values. Then, it calculates
the proportion of those simulations in which the forecast stock price meets or exceeds the target price generated by our valuation
methods.
